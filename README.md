# 🌍 Estimating Contributions from the Mining Sector to Close the Biodiversity Finance Gap

Contributions required to conserve and restore nature may be proportionate to companies' impact and determined by the value of the natural resources that companies destroy in their production processes. This repository provides a methodology testing this approach by measuring the impact of mining companies on vegetation density using satellite-based indicators.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project estimates the environmental cost of vegetation loss caused by mining operations by:
- Analyzing EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) time series for Natura 2000 and mining sites,
- Aggregating and cleaning PAF habitat restoration cost data,
- Computing per-site and per-hectare restoration costs,
- Extrapolating these costs to mining sites using vegetation loss and Natura 2000 estimates as proxy.

A **policy brief** was produced using the insights generated by this methodology and can be found in this repository.

## 🚀 How to run

1. **Install dependencies**  
   *(If not yet defined, create a `requirements.txt`)*
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Prepare your data**
   - Download and place the datasets in the `data/` folder, replicating the structure used in the project as described in the _Data sources to download_ section.

3. **Create and add your Google Earth Engine project name for extracting satellite data**
   - Create a GEE project following this process: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/access
   - Add the name of your project in `compute_evi.py`, line 13

4. **Run the pipeline**
   ```bash
   python get_cost_per_evi.py
   ```

4. **Check the results**
   - Results are written to `output/natura/` and `output/mining/` as `.csv` files.
